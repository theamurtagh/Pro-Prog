# Pro-Prog
## Project for Programming Assigment

Based dataset on Whisky dataset that focused on quality and flavors<br>
I thought to make a correlation to the age of the testers and preference<br>
Was not so successful in working out how to make the variables correlate.<br>
I entered a list of whisys from Kaggle (reference in notebook)<br> 
Created a dataset using a number of variables, such as<br> 
-  VOL
-  Years Aged
-  Shade
-  Sweetness
-  Heat
-  Smoke
-  Age of participant
-  Grade

-  I used numpy random to generate
